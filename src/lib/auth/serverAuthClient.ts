/**
 * Server-side Better Auth client.
 *
 * This module is intentionally NOT marked "use client" so it can be safely
 * imported from Server Components, Server Actions, and API route handlers.
 *
 * On every outgoing request it automatically:
 *  - Forwards the caller's cookies (from next/headers) so Better Auth
 *    can identify the session without any extra wiring at the call site.
 *  - Sets the Origin header to the auth-svc URL, which Better Auth
 *    requires to pass its origin check for server-to-server requests.
 *
 * For client-side usage keep using authClient from ./authClient instead.
